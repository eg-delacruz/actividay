- Visualize the UI in light or dark mode

#Technologies and justification

- React with Next JS framework
  The Next JS framework (v 14.1.2) was used because of the prebuild structure and low configuration needed to start a React project. Also a good choice to create a single pag application.
- TypeScript
  Used to take advantage of its benefits over JavaScript, like the use of interfaces and prevention of possible errors when passing data withing the app
- Redux
  Used to store the Activities data and to give access to that data among the different components
- SASS
  Used as an alternative over pure CSS. It allows us to make use of functions and mixins that can be reused.
- Next-themes
  A library that facilitates the implementation of different UI themes. In this case, it was used to provide light and dark mode
- Sweetalert 2
  Library used to create confirmation notifications when the user successfully (or unsuccessfully) completed an action/task.

#Further implementations for the future
Below are some ideas that could be implemented in the future to improve or extend the functionallity of the application:

- Possibility to filter activities from the list by category or range of participants
- A searchbar to easily find activities from the list
- Give the user the possibility to login, in order to be able to store his/her favourite activities
- After logged in, the user could share its activity list with other app users
